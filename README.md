# Need a good name for that project

Here I am going to keep the algorithms I find interesting.
Each algorithm is either a solution for some problem or just mini project 
that doesn't deserve a separate repository.

Below is the list of what I have right now:

1. src-py/problem1.py: Add new interval to a list of disjoint intervals
2. src-py/problem2.py: Partition of an integer number
  * Generator of all possible partitions of a given number (without recursion)
3. src-py/problem3.py: Rough surface generator. Utilized that algorithm to generate a
   heterogeneous geological layer in 2D reservoir modeling project.
4. src-py/problem4.py: Graph theory algos
