# Need good name for that project

Here I am going to keep the algorithms I find interesting.
Each algorithm is a solution for some problem.

Below is the list of what I have right now:

1. Problem 1: Add new interval to a list of disjoint intervals
2. Problem 2: Partition of an integer number
..* Generator of all possible partitions of a given number (without recursion)
